					<h1>Hi! I'm Rachel.</h1>

					<p>I'm a rising junior at Barnard College, Columbia University studying computer science on the 
					intelligent systems track. I'm interested in using technology to create positive impact. When I'm not studying, 
					I <a href="#writing">write</a> and edit for the Columbia Undergraduate Law Review, play tennis, and run :) </p>

					<h3> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/inthegreen" target="_blank">InTheGreen</a></h3>
					<p> HackCambridge </p>
		
					<p> My team and I built a webapp frontend that displays a user's personal "investment tree" linked with the user's stock portfolio.
					A Python backend hosted on Microsoft Azure tracks the fund composition in real-time and webscrapes environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) risk scores from Yahoo Finance. 
					A weighted average and other comparisons are computed and made available to the webapp through a Flask-API. </p>
			
					<p> Built with: azure, beautiful-soup, css, flask, html, javascript, json, numpy, pandas, python, regex</p>
					<p>Won 2nd place in the Microsoft Hack For Good Challenge</p>	
			
					<p>Check out our webapp here:</p>

					<h3> <a href="https://officehours.netlify.app/" target="_blank"> Office Hours Redesigned </a> </h3>
					<p> <a href = "http://designatcolumbia.com/" target="_blank">Design@Columbia </a></p>
					<p>My team and I sought to redesign the model of office hours for computer science courses at Columbia University. We looked to improve time efficiency and honor COVID social-distancing guidelines while retaining the working features of office hours. 
					We sketched and designed several solutions; our mockup highlights the main feature, a queue, for students to receive push notifications when it's their turn to ask questions. Next steps include researching with professors, implementing an announcement 
					feature, and developing a desktop version.</p>
					<p>Watch my team present our project here:</p>
